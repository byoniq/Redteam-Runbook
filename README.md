## Introduction

The **Red Teaming Runbook** provides a structured approach to executing red team operations. It serves as a practical guide for offensive security engagements aimed at identifying vulnerabilities, testing incident response, and improving the overall security posture of organizations.

## Red Team Engagement Phases

### Planning
- Define goals, objectives, and success criteria.
- Set engagement scope, timelines, and communication plans with stakeholders.

### Reconnaissance
- Gather intelligence through **OSINT**, **network scanning**, and **social engineering**.
- Tools: [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng), [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/).

### Weaponization
- Develop custom malware, payloads, and exploits.
- Tools: [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework), [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/), [Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire).

### Delivery
- Deliver the payload via **phishing**, **USB drops**, or **network exploitation**.
- Tools: [Phishing Frameworks](https://github.com/gophish/gophish), custom scripts.

### Exploitation
- Exploit weaknesses to gain initial access.
- Exploitation targets: Web apps, network services, endpoints.

### Command and Control
- Maintain persistent access and establish communication with compromised systems.
- Tools: [Covenant](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant), [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/).

### Action on Objectives
- Lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
- Techniques: Pass-the-Hash, [Kerberoasting](https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast).

### Reporting
- Document attack paths, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.
- Create detailed technical reports and executive summaries for stakeholders.

---

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

TTPs represent the adversarial tactics used during engagements to replicate real-world attacks. Key TTPs include:

- **Initial Access**: Phishing, exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Lateral Movement**: Credential theft, RDP hijacking.
- **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks, backdoors.
- **Exfiltration**: Covertly transferring sensitive data out of the network.

---

## Rules of Engagement (RoE)

The **RoE** ensures that the red team operates within defined legal and ethical boundaries. It specifies:

- What systems can be attacked (in-scope systems).
- Restrictions on certain actions (e.g., no data destruction).
- Communication protocols with the Blue Team and stakeholders.

---

## Tools and Infrastructure

A successful red team operation requires various tools and infrastructure for reconnaissance, exploitation, C2, and reporting.

- **Reconnaissance Tools**: [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan).
- **Exploitation Tools**: [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework), [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).
- **C2 Tools**: [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/), [Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire).
- **Reporting Tools**: [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter), [KeepNote](http://keepnote.org/).

---

## Operational Security (OPSEC)

OPSEC is critical in red teaming to avoid detection by the Blue Team. Key OPSEC considerations:

- Use of encryption for communication (e.g., VPNs, Tor).
- Avoid using corporate devices or networks.
- Regularly change infrastructure (IP addresses, domains).

---

## Simulating Threat Actors

Simulate different types of adversaries to make the engagement more realistic:

- **Nation-State Actors**: Targeting high-value data using sophisticated techniques.
- **Insider Threats**: Gaining access through internal compromise or rogue employees.
- **Hacktivists**: Focused on defacing websites or leaking data.

---

## Post-Engagement Review

After the engagement, conduct a **debriefing** with stakeholders, discuss findings, and identify areas of improvement. Ensure that:

- Detailed reports are delivered.
- Vulnerabilities are communicated to the Blue Team.
- A timeline of attack sequences is reviewed.

---

## Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement

Each engagement should result in a list of **lessons learned** to refine future red team activities. Key areas to assess:

- Were there any detection or communication gaps?
- What tactics were the most effective?
- How can the team's processes be improved?

---

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

Ensure that all activities comply with applicable laws and internal regulations:

- **Legal Frameworks**: Understand and comply with laws like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** and **GDPR**.
- **Engagement Contracts**: Ensure contracts include a detailed scope and waiver of liability in case of system disruption.
