## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the **Red Teaming Runbook**. This document provides a structured approach for executing red team operations. It serves as a guide for red teamers to follow best practices during engagements to identify vulnerabilities, test incident response, and improve overall security posture.

---

## 2. Red Teaming Overview
Red teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered approach to testing an organization's cybersecurity by simulating realistic adversary attacks. The goal is to identify and exploit weaknesses across people, processes, and technology.

- **Purpose**: To simulate real-world attack scenarios and measure detection and response capabilities.
- **Scope**: Focuses on both external and internal threats, covering physical, digital, and social engineering vectors.

---

## 3. Team Structure and Roles
A successful red team requires a range of skills and clearly defined roles. Below is a sample breakdown of typical red team roles:

### 3.1 Red Team Lead
- Responsible for overall planning, execution, and reporting.
- Coordinates with Blue Team and stakeholders.
  
### 3.2 Operators
- Perform the actual attack activities, including network exploitation, application attacks, and physical breaches.

### 3.3 Reconnaissance Specialist
- Focuses on OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and pre-engagement intelligence gathering.

### 3.4 Exploitation Specialist
- Responsible for developing and executing custom exploits based on identified vulnerabilities.

### 3.5 Infrastructure and Tools Engineer
- Builds and maintains the red team’s attack infrastructure, including C2 servers and staging environments.

---

## 4. Red Team Engagement Phases

### 4.1 Planning
- Define goals, objectives, and success criteria.
- Scope of the engagement.
- Set timelines and communication plans.

### 4.2 Reconnaissance
- Conduct OSINT and technical recon.
- Tools: Shodan, Google Dorking, Recon-ng.

### 4.3 Weaponization
- Develop custom malware, payloads, and exploits.
- Tools: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Empire.

### 4.4 Delivery
- Deliver the payload to the target via phishing, USB drops, or network exploitation.
- Tools: Phishing frameworks, custom scripts.

### 4.5 Exploitation
- Execute the attack and gain an initial foothold.
- Exploiting web apps, network services, or endpoints.

### 4.6 Command and Control (C2)
- Maintain persistent access to the compromised system.
- C2 Tools: Covenant, Cobalt Strike.

### 4.7 Action on Objectives
- Lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
- Techniques: Pass-the-hash, Kerberoasting.

### 4.8 Reporting
- Draft the initial findings and escalate to leadership.
- Create detailed attack paths and remediations.

---

## 5. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
Outline the common tactics used by adversaries, and how the red team can replicate these during an engagement. Examples of TTPs include:

- **Initial Access**: Spear phishing, exploit vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks.
- **Execution**: PowerShell scripts, DLL injection, remote code execution.
- **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks, registry modifications, web shells.

---

## 6. Rules of Engagement (RoE)
The RoE outlines the constraints and limitations on red team activities to ensure operations remain within legal and ethical bounds.

- **Do’s**: 
  - Target systems agreed upon by stakeholders.
  - Respect operational hours for critical systems.
  
- **Don’ts**:
  - Avoid attacks that could result in data loss or corruption.
  - No physical harm to employees or intentional service disruptions.

---

## 7. Tools and Infrastructure
Detail the tools commonly used for various stages of a red team engagement:

### 7.1 Reconnaissance Tools
- **OSINT**: Recon-ng, Maltego, SpiderFoot.
- **Network Scanners**: Nmap, Masscan.

### 7.2 Exploitation Tools
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Nessus, OpenVAS.
- **Payload Generators**: MSFVenom, Shellter.

### 7.3 Command & Control (C2) Frameworks
- **Cobalt Strike**
- **Empire**
- **Sliver**

### 7.4 Custom Infrastructure
- Guidelines for building resilient and covert C2 infrastructure using VPS, cloud providers, and domain fronting.

---

## 8. Operational Security (OPSEC)
Best practices for ensuring the red team’s activities remain stealthy and undetected:

- Use of encryption for all communications.
- Avoid using corporate devices for red teaming.
- Regularly rotate IP addresses and domains for C2 servers.

---

## 9. Simulating Different Threat Actors
To provide realistic scenarios, the red team should simulate various types of attackers:

### 9.1 Nation-State Attack Simulation
- Target high-value systems and data.
- Use advanced techniques like custom malware and zero-days.

### 9.2 Insider Threat Simulation
- Focus on gaining access through internal users or compromised credentials.
- Blend in with normal traffic and behavior.

---

## 10. Reporting and Post-Engagement

### 10.1 Attack Path Documentation
- Provide detailed walkthroughs of how the red team exploited weaknesses.
- Include screenshots, logs, and technical details of each step.

### 10.2 Remediation Recommendations
- Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### 10.3 Executive Summary
- A high-level overview of the engagement for C-suite leadership.

---

## 11. Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement
Each engagement should be followed by a review of:

- **What went well**.
- **What could be improved**.
- **Changes to make for the next engagement**.

---

## 12. Compliance and Legal Considerations
Ensure that all activities comply with legal frameworks such as:

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **ISO 27001**

---

## 13. Appendices

### 13.1 Glossary of Terms
- **C2**: Command and Control
- **TTPs**: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

### 13.2 Example Reports
- Include a sanitized example of a red team engagement report.
  
### 13.3 Tool Configuration
- Example configurations for commonly used red team tools like Cobalt Strike and Empire.

---

## Conclusion
This runbook is intended to serve as a guide for executing red team engagements, providing a structured approach to attacking and testing an organization’s security posture. Continuous improvement, legal adherence, and precision in execution are critical for successful operations.
